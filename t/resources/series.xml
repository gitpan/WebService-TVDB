<Overview>Gary needs a lodger to help pay the mortgage on his flat. Unfortunately, neither of his lodgers seems to be able (or willing) to pay any rent at all!
First there's Dermot and then Tony. Both of these fall for Deborah, who owns the flat upstairs, but get nowhere.
Gary also has thoughts in that direction - his problem being the fact that he has a regular girlfiend, Dorothy, who he lives with!</Overview>
